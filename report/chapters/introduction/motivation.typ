// Queue in the context of HPC
// - Common HPC use cases
// - How HPC arranges matters
// - Problems that usually arise in HPC/The nature of these problems
// - Why the need for communication/job scheduling
// - The criteria for a mean to do this? -> efficient & robust queue
// - Queue can be implemented using a new programming model, compared to the old model -> its advantages, potential -> investigate this
