This section discusses the correctness and progress guarantee properties of the distributed MPSC algorithms introduced in @distributed-queues[]. We also provide a theoretical performance model of these algorithms to predict how well they scale to multiple nodes.

== Theoretical proofs of the distributed SPSC

In this section, we focus on the correctness and progress guarantee of the simple distributed SPSC established in @distributed-spsc.
