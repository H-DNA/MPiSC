In this thesis, we introduced Slotqueue and dLTQueueV2, two high-performance non-blocking distributed MPSC (Multi-Producer Single-Consumer) queues that achieve constant-time complexity for both enqueue and dequeue operations through a fixed number of remote operations. Our research encompassed both theoretical analysis of Slotqueue and dLTQueueV2's properties—including fault tolerance capabilities and performance characteristics—and comprehensive empirical benchmarking against the existing AMQueue implementation.

Our findings demonstrate that Slotqueue and dLTQueueV2 achieve wait-free operation with superior fault tolerance guarantees, maintaining constant remote operation counts for all queue operations. The experimental results reveal mixed performance outcomes: Slotqueue and dLTQueueV2 surpass AMQueue in enqueue throughput while experiencing 3-10 times lower performance for dequeue operations compared to AMQueue.

However, our evaluation identified two significant limitations in Slotqueue and dLTQueueV2's current designs. First, the system experiences substantial contention degradation as the node count increases, resulting in poor scalability characteristics under large-scale deployments. Second, our existing performance model inadequately captures contention effects, leading to inaccurate throughput predictions across varying cluster sizes.

Based on these findings, our future research directions will focus on two primary objectives: developing contention mitigation strategies to prevent the dequeuer node from becoming a performance bottleneck, and creating more sophisticated performance models that accurately incorporate contention dynamics to provide reliable scalability predictions.
