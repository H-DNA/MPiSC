This thesis explores how shared-memory programming principles, particularly the use of atomic operations, can be applied to model and develop distributed MPSC queue algorithms. We examined existing MPSC queue algorithms from shared-memory literature and adapted them for distributed computing environments using our proposed model. Based on this foundation, we developed two novel distributed MPSC queue algorithms: dLTQueue and Slotqueue. We provided formal proofs demonstrating key theoretical properties of these algorithms, including their correctness, fault-tolerance capabilities, and performance characteristics. To validate our theoretical findings, we conducted empirical benchmarks comparing queue behavior with an existing algorithm called Active Message Queue (AMQueue) referenced in @amqueue.
