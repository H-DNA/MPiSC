This thesis is the culmination of joint efforts coming from not only myself, but also my professors, my family, my friends and other teachers of Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

I want to first acknowledge my university, Ho Chi Minh University of Tecnology. Throughout my four years of pursuing education here, I have built a strong theoretical foundation and earned various practical experiences. These all lend themselves well to the completion of this thesis. However, I have to say that the one person that plays the cornerstone in my acedemic foundation must be Mr. Diệp Thanh Đăng. Any of my works and achievements can only be built properly upon this cornerstone that he forever laid in my foundation. He has been the constant supervisor and reliable consultant through this capstone project, right from its inception, throughout its nurturing until the very end. The project couldn't have reached this stage of maturity without Mr. Đăng. Therefore, he has the rights to share whatever yields this project has to offer. I know it's getting informal, but if you ever read this, I want you to know that you surely have become one of the most important person in my life. You are the right blend of intellect, wisdom, organization, empathy, open-mindedness that I always seek in an academic companion, which surely secures you a special place in my heart. Whatever the outcome of what's about to happen, whoever I become in the future, I won't ever forget you, our magical moments when we're brewing up this project, and will credit you for anything I earn, in front of just anyone, including myself. Yes, I'm that kind of person, sincere, grateful, supportive, mentally-simulated and I sure believe no one else would respect you as much as I do. I always imagine myself as Friedrich Engels, finding for myself a Karl Marx, and I bet you're qualified for that role.

I want to thank Mr. Thoại Nam for providing all the facilities and infrastructure that this project necessitates. He essentially funded all of our idea-brewing grounds, where magic happens.

I also want to give my family the sincerest thanks for their emotional and financial support, without which I couldn't have whole-heartedly followed my research till the end.

Last but not least important, I want to thank my closest friends for their informal but ever-constant check-ups to make sure I didn't miss the timeline for this specialized project, which I usually don't have the mental capacity for.
