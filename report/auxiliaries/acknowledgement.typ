I want to extend my gratitude towards my supervisors, Mr.Thoại Nam and Mr. Diệp Thanh Đăng, who have acted as constant counselors and advisors from the project's inception throughout. They have led the direction and laid the academic basis for this project, upon which my work is essentially built upon. Without them, this project wouldn't have reached this point of creation.

I also want to give my family the sincerest thanks for their emotional and financial support, without which I couldn't have whole-heartedly followed my research till the end.

Lastly, I want to thank my closest friends for their informal but ever-constant check-ups to make sure I followed through the timeline for this specialized project, which I usually don't have the mental capacity for.
