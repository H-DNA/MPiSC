This thesis is the culmination of joint efforts coming from not only myself, but also my professors, my family, my friends and other teachers of Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

I want to first acknowledge my university, Ho Chi Minh University of Tecnology. Throughout my four years of pursuing education here, I have built a strong theoretical foundation and earned various practical experiences. These all lend themselves well to the completion of this thesis. Especially, I want to extend my gratitude towards my supervisors, Mr.Thoại Nam and Mr. Diệp Thanh Đăng, who have acted as constant counselors and advisors right from the project's inception throughout. They have provided guidance on the project's direction and laid the academic basis for this project, upon which my work is essentially built upon. Furthermore, they inspired me to work hard and push through all the technical obstacles. Without them, this project wouldn't have reached this point of creation.

I also want to give my family the sincerest thanks for their emotional and financial support, without which I couldn't have whole-heartedly followed my research till the end.

Last but not least important, I want to thank my closest friends for their informal but ever-constant check-ups to make sure I didn't miss the timeline for this specialized project, which I usually don't have the mental capacity for.
