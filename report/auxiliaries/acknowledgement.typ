This thesis is the culmination of joint efforts coming from not only myself, but also my professors, my family, my friends and other teachers of Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

I want to first acknowledge my university, Ho Chi Minh University of Technology. Throughout my four years of pursuing education here, I have built a strong theoretical foundation and gained various practical experiences. These all lend themselves well to the completion of this thesis. However, I have to say that the one person who plays the cornerstone in my academic foundation must be Mr. Diệp Thanh Đăng. He has been the constant supervisor and reliable consultant through this capstone project, right from its inception, throughout its nurturing until the very end. The project could not have reached this stage of maturity without Mr. Đăng. Therefore, he has the right to share whatever yields this project has to offer. I know it is getting informal, but if you ever read this, I want you to know that you surely have become one of the most important people in my life. You are the right blend of intellect, wisdom, organization, empathy, open-mindedness that I always seek in an academic companion, which surely secures you a special place in my heart. Whatever the outcome of what is about to happen, whoever I become in the future, I will not ever forget you and our magical moments when we were brewing up this project. I want to credit you for anything I achieve in front of just anyone, including myself. I have always craved a companionship like Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx; maybe I have come quite close to it.

I want to thank Mr. Thoại Nam for providing all the facilities and infrastructure that this project necessitates. He essentially funded all of our idea-brewing grounds, where magic happens.

I also want to give my family the sincerest thanks for their emotional and financial support, without which I could not have wholeheartedly followed my research till the end.

Last but not least important, I want to thank my closest friends for their informal but ever-constant check-ups to make sure I did not miss the timeline for this capstone project, which I usually do not have the mental capacity for.
