= Original LTQueue

The original algorithm is given in @ltqueue by Prasad Jayanti and Srdjan Petrovic in 2005. LTQueue is a wait-free MPSC algorithm, with logarithmic-time for both enqueue and dequeue. The algorithm achieves good scalability by distributing the "global" queue over $n$ queues that are local to each enqueuer. This helps avoid contention on the global queue among the enqueuers and allows multiple enqueuers to succeed at the same time. Furthermore, each enqueue and dequeue is efficient: they are wait-free and guaranteed to complete in $theta(log n)$ where $n$ is the number of enqueuers. This is possible due to the novel tree structure proposed by the authors.

== Local queue algorithm

Each local queue in LTQueue is an SPSC that allows an enqueuer and a dequeuer to concurrently access. This suffices as only the enqueuer that the queue is local to and the one-and-only dequeuer ever access the local queue.

This section presents the SPSC data structure proposed in @ltqueue. Beside the usual `enqueue` and `dequeue` procedures, this SPSC also supports the `readFront` procedure, which allows the enqueuer and dequeuer to retrieve the first item in the SPSC. Notice that enqueuer and dequeuer each has its own `readFront` method.

]

#pseudocode-list(line-numbering: none)[
  + *Initialization*

The SPSC always has a dummy node at the end.

      + `tmp' = FreeLater`
      + `FreeLater = tmp`
      + `free(tmp')`

  )[
    + `tmp = First                                  `
    + *if* `(tmp == Last)`
      + *return* $bot$
    + *return* `tmp.val`
  ],
)

The treatment of linearizability, wait-freedom and memory safety is given in the original paper @ltqueue. However, we can establish some intuition by looking at the procedures.

For wait-freedom, each procedure doesn't loop and doesn't wait for any other procedures to be able to complete on its own, therefore, they are all wait-free.

For memory safety, note that `spsc_enqueue` never accesses freed memory because the node pointed to by `Last` is never freed inside `spsc_dequeue`. `spsc_readFront`#sub[`e`] tries to read `First` (line 6) and announces it not to be deleted to the dequeuer (line 8), it then checks if the pointer it read is still `First` (line 9), if it is, then it's safe to dereference the pointer (line 11) because the dequeuer would take note not to free it (line 18), otherwise, it returns `Help` (line 10), which is safely placed by the dequeuer (line 16). `spsc_dequeue` safely reclaims memory and does not leak memory (line 18-22). `spsc_readFront`#sub[`d`] is safe because there's only one dequeuer running at a time.

For linearizability, the linearization point of `spsc_enqueue` is after line 5, `spsc_readFront`#sub[`e`] is right after line 8, `spsc_dequeue` is right after line 17 and `spsc_readFront`#sub[`d`] is right after line 25. Additionally, all the operations take constant time no matter the size of the queue.

== LTQueue algorithm

LTQueue's idea is to maintain a tree structure as in @ltqueue-tree. Each enqueuer is represented by the local SPSC node at the bottom of the tree. Every SPSC node in the local queue contains data and a timestamp indicating when it's enqueued into the SPSC. For consistency in node structure, we consider the leaf nodes of the tree to be the ones that are attached to the local SPSC of each enqueuer. Every internal node contains the minimum timestamp among its children's timestamps.

    + `ret = spsc_dequeue(&Q[rank])`
    + `propagate(&Q[rank])`

  ],
)

The followings are the timestamp propagation procedures.

Note that compare to the original paper @ltqueue, we have make some trivial modification on line 11-12 to handle the leaf node case, which was left unspecified in the original algorithm. In many ways, this modification is in the same light with the mechanism the algorithm is already using, so intuitively, it should not affect the algorithm's correctness or wait-freedom.

    + `leafNode = leafNode(spsc)                      `
    + `LL(leafNode)`
    + `SC(leafNode, readFront(spsc))`
  ],
)

Similarly, the proofs of LTQueue's linearizability, wait-freedom, memory-safety and logarithmic-time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations are given in @ltqueue. One notable technique that allows LTQueue to be both correct and wait-free is the double-refresh trick during the propagation process on line 16-17.

The idea behind the `propagate` procedure is simple: Each time an SPSC queue is modified (inserted/deleted), the timestamp of a leaf has changed so the timestamps of all nodes on the path from that leaf to the root can potentially change. Therefore, we have to propagate the change towards the root, starting from the leaf (line 11-18).

The `refresh` procedure is by itself simple: we access all child nodes to determine the minimum timestamp and try to set the current node's timestamp with the determined minimum timestamp using a pair of LL/SC. However, LL/SC can not always succeed so the current node's timestamp may not be updated by `refresh` at all. The key to fix this is to retry `refresh` on line 17 in case of the first `refresh`'s failure. Later, when we prove the correctness of the modified LTQueue, we provide a formal proof of why this works. Here, we visualize the case where both `refresh` fails but correctness is still ensures in @double-refresh for some intuition.
