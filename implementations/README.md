# Implementations

This folder holds the implementations of several hand-picked shared memory MPSC algorithms ported to distributed context using MPI RMA.

Porting challenges & strategies are discussed further in these algorithms' folders.

Some have accompanying reports to prove their correctness when modification to the original algorithms is necessary

## Ported algorithms
